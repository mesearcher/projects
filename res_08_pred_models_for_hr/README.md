# Predictive Models for HR #


**Project Objective:**

By leveraging HR analysis, businesses can enhance employee productivity and proactively manage staff turnover. 
This project focuses on supporting a team of HR analysts to streamline their processes for greater efficiency.
In alignment with the customerâ€™s business objectives, the project will involve the creation of two predictive models:

1. The first model will predict employee satisfaction levels based on customer data.
2. The second model will anticipate when an employee might decide to leave the company.


**Data Source:**

The entire dataset contains information about the company's employees, presented in five files.
For the first model, the target attribute is the level of employee satisfaction with work in the company. 
This information is derived from feedback forms, where employees complete a test questionnaire. 
Their satisfaction percentage is then calculated on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents complete dissatisfaction, and 1 signifies complete satisfaction.
For the second model, the target attribute is the employee's departure from the company.
