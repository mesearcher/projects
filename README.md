# Completed projects

During my professional training course on Data Science by Yandex (from August 2023 to April 2024), I completed 13 projects.
These projects involved creating predictive models to solve various applied problems utilizing machine learning approaches,
such as linear regression, logistic regression for binary classification, binary text classification, and implementing 
a deep Convolutional Neural Network for age estimation based on the ResNet50 model, among others.
