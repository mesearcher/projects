# Predictive Models for Dairy Farm Risk Management #

**Project Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to analyze data from a dairy farm and create two predictive models to enhance business risk management. 
To achieve this, the following steps will be performed:
1. Pre-processing of data.
2. Exploratory analysis.
3. Data preparation for machine learning.
4. Model selection and training algorithm.
5. Training, setting, testing, and checking model quality.
6. Forecast and conclusions.

Considering the customerâ€™s business objectives, two predictive models will be created:

1. The first model will predict the potential milk yield of the cow (linear regression task).
2. The second model will calculate the probability of obtaining high-quality milk from a cow (logistic regression task for binary classification).


**Data Source:**

The dataset consists of three files containing information on the current herd, cow producers, and EcoFarm cows.
The format and structure of these files will be thoroughly explored, and any considerations regarding data quality will be addressed.

**Tools and libraries:**

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- Math
- Phik
