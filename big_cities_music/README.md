Analyzing User Behavior in Two Major Russian Cities on Yandex.Music

Utilizing data from Yandex.Music, we examine user behavior in Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
The dataset includes track details like artist, genre, city, time, and day. 
Our goal is to contrast musical preferences between the cities. 
Specifically, we compare Monday, Wednesday, and Friday listening habits and genre choices during Monday mornings and Friday evenings.
