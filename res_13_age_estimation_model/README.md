# Age Estimation Model #

**Annotation:**

The project aims to develop a deep Convolutional Neural Network for age estimation based on the ResNet50 model.
The following steps will be taken to achieve this:

1. Data Pre-processing
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
4. Model Selection and Training Algorithm
5. Training, Testing, and Model Evaluation

Aligned with the customerâ€™s business objectives, the project involves creating a regression model to enable the retail chain to implement a computer vision system for estimating customer ages based on facial images.

**Data Source:**

The study utilizes the APPA-REAL dataset, a comprehensive face image database containing 7591 images, each accompanied by corresponding age tags.
