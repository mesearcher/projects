**Annotation:**

The project aims to develop a text classification model. To achieve this, the following steps will be taken:

1. Data Pre-processing
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
4. Model Selection and Training Algorithm
5. Training, Setting, Testing, and Checking Model Quality
6. Forecast and Conclusion

In alignment with the customerâ€™s business objectives, the project involves creating a text classification model that will enable the company to identify toxic user comments and forward them for moderation (a binary text classification task).
