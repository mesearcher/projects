1. Pre-processing of Data
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
4. Model Selection and Training Algorithm
5. Training, Setting, Testing, and Checking Model Quality
6. Forecast and Findings
7. Segmentation of Customers Based on Modeling Forecast
8. Conclusion and Recommendations
