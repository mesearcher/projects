# Completed projects

Throughout my professional training course in Data Science with Yandex (spanning from August 2023 to April 2024), I successfully completed 14 projects. 
These projects encompassed the development of predictive models aimed at addressing diverse practical challenges using machine learning methodologies. 
Tasks included employing techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression for binary classification, binary text classification, and deploying a deep Convolutional Neural Network for age estimation, leveraging the ResNet50 model, among others.
