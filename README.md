# Completed projects

During my intensive Data Science training at Yandex from August 2023 to April 2024, I completed 15 projects aimed at addressing real-world challenges using machine learning methodologies. 
Specializing in predictive modeling, I utilized techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, binary text classification, and deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks, notably employing the ResNet50 model for tasks like age estimation. 
Additionally, I managed SQL tasks for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis, contributing to comprehensive data-driven solutions. These projects provided invaluable hands-on experience in solving diverse data science problems.
