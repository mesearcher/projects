# Completed projects

During my Data Science training at Yandex from August 2023 to April 2024, I completed 15 projects focusing on real-world challenges using machine learning methods. 
I specialized in predictive modeling, employing a range of techniques including linear regression, logistic regression, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, and deep learning with CNNs, among other methods. 
I also handled SQL tasks for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis. These projects provided practical experience in solving diverse data science problems.
