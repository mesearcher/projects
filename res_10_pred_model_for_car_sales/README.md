# Predictive Model for Car Sales #


**Project Objective:**

The project aims to develop a predictive model that assists app users in determining the market value of a used car.
To achieve this, the following steps will be taken:

1. Data Pre-processing
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
4. Model Selection and Training Algorithm
5. Training, Setting, Testing, and Checking Model Quality
6. Forecast and Conclusion

In alignment with the customer's business objectives, the project involves the creation of a predictive model to estimate car costs, addressing a linear regression problem.

The customer considers the importance of the following criteria:
- Quality of Prediction
- Model Training Time
- Model Prediction Time
