# Predictive Model for Taxi Service #


**Project Objective:**

The project aims to develop a model that predicts the number of taxi orders for the next hour.
To achieve this, the following steps will be taken:

1. Data Pre-processing
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
4. Model Selection and Training Algorithm
5. Training, Setting, Testing, and Checking Model Quality
6. Forecast and Conclusion

In alignment with the customerâ€™s business objectives, the project involves creating a model for predicting taxi service load, specifically addressing peak hours (a linear regression problem for time series forecasting).

**Data Source:**

The dataset provided by the customer contains historical data on taxi orders at airports.

**Tools and libraries:**

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- LightGBM
