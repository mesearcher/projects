# Scooter Sharing Analysis #

**Project Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to analyze data from GoFast, an e-scooter sharing service, and test several hypotheses:
1. Do subscribed users spend more time riding? We will measure this by comparing the average riding time of subscribed users to non-subscribed users.
   If confirmed, this could suggest that users with subscriptions are more profitable for the company.
2. Can we assert that the average distance traveled by users with a subscription in one trip does not exceed an optimal threshold in terms of scooter wear and tear? 
   We will define and assess this threshold.
3. Will the monthly revenue from users with a subscription exceed the revenue from users without a subscription? 
   We will conduct a comparative analysis to determine the financial impact of subscriptions.
4. What is the minimum number of promotional codes that must be distributed to ensure a roughly 5% chance of not meeting the marketing department's plan? 
   We will employ statistical methods to calculate this number while maintaining a 5% risk level.
5. Can we estimate the probability that notifications will be opened by no more than a specified number of users? 
   We will model the likelihood of notification open rates based on user thresholds.

**Data Source:**
This project relies on three datasets obtained from GoFast, encompassing user information, ride history, and subscription data. 
We will perform data cleaning and preprocessing as needed to ensure data quality and relevance. 

**Expected Outcomes:**

Through this analysis, we aim to provide actionable insights for GoFast. We anticipate revealing patterns related to 
user subscriptions, ride optimization, revenue generation, marketing effectiveness, and user engagement.
