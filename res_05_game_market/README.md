# Game Market Analysis #

**Project Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to identify patterns that influence the success of video game sales. 
To do this, we will analyze the data and answer the following research questions:
1. Which gaming platforms have exhibited the highest sales popularity across various time periods?
2. What is the typical time frame for the emergence of new gaming platforms, and when do older platforms phase out?
3. Which platforms are leading in sales, and are they growing or declining?
4. How do user and critic reviews affect sales on one popular platform?
5. Are there genres with high and low sales?
6. What characteristics define the profiles of gaming platform users in North America, Europe, and Japan?
7. Can we assert that the average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are equal?
8. Can we assert that the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are distinct?

**Data Source:**
